# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard – Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes sales performance for a coffee shop chain.  
The workflow started with importing raw sales data from **CSV files into SQL Server**, where I performed **data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis** using SQL queries.  
The cleaned and structured data was then connected to **Power BI** to build a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key business metrics, sales trends, and product performance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Track total **sales**, **orders**, and **quantities sold** with month-over-month comparison.  
- Visualize **sales trends** across days and hours to understand customer behavior.  
- Identify **top-performing products** and **categories**.  
- Compare performance between **weekdays vs. weekends** and **store locations**.  
- Provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.
